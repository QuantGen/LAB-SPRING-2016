Papers: chose one paper from the list below or propose one. Papers should: (a) introduce novel metholdology that is relevant to the topics of research of interest of the group, or (b) be relevant to the particular applications you are working on. 

Software: we will organize 1-2 sections to share software being developed by the group. 

Grant proposals: if time permit we will include on section on grant writing (format to be determined).
